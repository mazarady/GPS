GPS Program to find Directions from Point A to Point B

I wrote this program using the Mapquest API. I accessed the API and used it to give me directions from point A to point B,
but also it gave me the total time to get to that certain place, the total distance (in miles) traveled, the LAT/LONG and 
lastly the elevation. Enjoy
