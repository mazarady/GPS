GPS Program to find Directions from Point A to Point B

I wrote this program using the Mapquest API. I accessed the API to give me directions from point A to point B,
 the total time of travel, the total distance (in miles) traveled, the LAT/LONG and the elevation. Moreover, I implemented JSON to help me complete this task. Enjoy
